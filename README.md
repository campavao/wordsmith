# Wordsmith

A story-based league competition! Go head to head against friends over who can create the best short story based
on a two sentence prompt. Everyone gets the same prompt, but not everyone has the same idea!

Get started by going to **Friend League** and create a game. After creating, you'll get a league code you can send out to your friends for them to join. Folks are able to join until the last person has submitted on the first round.
